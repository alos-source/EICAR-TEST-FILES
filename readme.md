## What is EICAR?
EICAR is providing a Test-File designed to simulate a virus or malware attack. The EICAR-TEST-FILE is a simple text file that contains a specific string of characters that is recognized by antivirus software as a Test-File and handled like malware.

## Purpose of this repository
The purpose of this repository is to provide a convenient source for downloading the EICAR-TEST-FILE. This file can be used to test antivirus software and observe its behavior. This repository is for *educational purposes only*. 

## Usage
To use the EICAR-TEST-FILE, download the encrypted archive from this repository and save it to your computer. The archive is encrypted to bypass browser security scanners. This way it is possible download and store the file, without scanners sound an alarm. 

The `EICARTestArchive_crypt.zip` focuses on variants of the EICAR-TEST-FILE in different formats of archives (.zip and .7z) and encrypted archives. Encrypted archives here are attached with the suffix "_crypt", unencrypted archives withe the suffix "_plain".

To access the EICAR-TEST-FILE, extract the contents of the archive and enter the password that is provided in the `PW.txt` file. You can then run a scan using your antivirus software to how it detects and quarantines the file.

Please note that the EICAR-TEST-FILE is not a real virus, and should be recognized as EICAR.
